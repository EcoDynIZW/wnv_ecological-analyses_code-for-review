This repository contains the **data** to follow the mosquito and bird community diversity analyses in relation to infection rates (MIR) with West Nile virus. Scripts are stored in the **R** folder and are built based on a wrapper script that calls three different analysis files and runs the script in a loop across three years (2023, 2024, and 2023 and 2024 combined into 9999). If you want to run everything in one go, set the FLAG_run to 1 in the wrapper. If you want to run single scripts, set the FLAG_run <- 0 and provide the *data_year* you want to analyse at the top of each respective script. All **plots** and **output** files are stored in a respective year and Sys.Date folder to not overwrite previous analyses.
Second, there is also a separate script showing the analyses for comparing the field survey from 2025 with the modelled bird abundances based on a field survey conducted in 2017 (Planillo et al. 2021, Div Distr).
Have fun checking the code!
